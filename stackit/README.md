## Backend

The backend is built using Node.js and TypeScript, providing a RESTful API for the frontend to interact with. It includes:

- **Controllers**: Handle the business logic for user authentication, questions, answers, notifications, and administrative tasks.
- **Models**: Define the data structures for users, questions, answers, and notifications.
- **Routes**: Set up the API endpoints for the application.
- **Middleware**: Protect routes and manage user roles.
- **Utilities**: Provide helper functions for various tasks.

## Frontend

The frontend is built using React, providing a user-friendly interface for interacting with the backend. It includes:

- **Components**: Reusable UI elements such as navigation bars, question lists, and forms for submitting answers.
- **Pages**: Different views for the application, including home, login, and registration pages.
- **Context**: Manage authentication state across the application.
- **API**: Functions for making requests to the backend.
